# Differential equations
A differential equation is one containing both [[functions]] and their [[derivative]](s), such as:
$$ \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot y = x^2 $$
$$ y'' + y' + 2y = 3x-1 $$

An $n$th order differential has a highest derivative of $n$, i.e.
- First order has $\frac{dy}{dx}$
- Third order has $\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}$
